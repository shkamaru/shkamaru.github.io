  excerpt:
    I am an alumni of IIT Roorkee (batch 2019 Electrical Engineering) who got a chance to study other interesting subjects out of interests like Marketing   Research and Data Analysis, Artificial Neural Networks, Data Structures and Algorithms, Robotics, Microprocessor, Economics, Fuzzy Logics etc. 
    <br/> <br/>
    Worked on 3 amazing projects throughout my college with the best work done on the autonomous flight system of drones using fuzzy logics and comparing results with other ML alogrithms. Other projects were around Marketing Research and Neural Networks. 
    <br/> <br/>
    Since college I have indulged in multiple fields to figure out my interests. I have been involved in fields like graphic designing, development, data science, trading, product design, information security. But one thing which I kept on doing was never stop myself from learning things and quickly realizing what is I want to do. After all this I finally decided to go after Product Management.
