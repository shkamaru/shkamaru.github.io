### Site Specs
- Made using Jekyll. It is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites written in Ruby. It takes text written in markup language and uses layouts to create a static website. Currently on `Jekyll Version - 4.1.1`

- Bundler is used along with Jekyll. It can be a great tool to use with Jekyll because it tracks dependencies on a per-project basis.

- Liquid is the templating language to process pages on the site. Liquid can output and modify variables, have logic statements inside the pages and loop over content.

- YAML is a format that relies on white spacing to separate out the various elements of content. Jekyll allows to use Liquid with YAML as a way to parse through the data. Storing items for the table of contents is one of the most common uses of YAML with Jekyll.
