### Site Specs
This is made using Jekyll. It is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites written in Ruby. It takes text written in markup language and uses layouts to create a static website. Liquid is the templating language to process pages on the site. Liquid can output and modify variables, have logic statements inside the pages and loop over content.

Running currently on `Jekyll Version - 4.1.1`

Bundler is used along with Jekyll. It can be a great tool to use with Jekyll because it tracks dependencies on a per-project basis.
